# SyrenApp

App for the SyrenSystem.

The SyrenApp allows the user to inspect sensor distances within a top-down view, modify volume values for each individual speaker, and give them descriptive labels. In the background, it is reading out the SyrenSensor distances and propagates these to the SyrenServer.
